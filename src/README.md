# Financial Data Manager Project 
Team Members: Carissa Trieu and Ashwath Balaji
## Brief Overview 
There are many ways for companies to report financial information, and it makes it inefficient and time-consuming to analyze and compare it. The objective of our project is to build a database system that improves the process by organizing the data from multiple companies. Users will be able to more efficiently make informed decisions while spending less time and effort looking for the right data.
