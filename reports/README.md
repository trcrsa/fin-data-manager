# Reports Folder

In this folder, you will find our Deliverable 8 and Deliverable 12 reports. 

- *my-ddl.sql*: This is our DDL SQL file. 
- */images*: This is a folder of screenshots provided for the Deliverable 12 report. 

## How to Run
The report can be viewed by building the .qmd file or downloading *deliver-08.html* or *deliver-12.html* directly from this repository. If the former option is chosen, Quarto must be installed to run the two commands in the terminal. Running *quarto render deliver-xx.qmd* will create the HTML file of the report. Run *open deliver-xx.html* after obtaining *deliver-xx.html*. To view and run this report, a live connection to the database is not needed.
