# Financial Data Manager Project

## Project Overview and Key Deliverables
The Financial Data Manager project is a project created by two Computer Science majors also pursuing minors in General Business. The purpose of this project is to aid investors in making the best investment choices in the stock market. Our database provides the necessary financial data that an investor can find highly useful to evaluate a company's financial health and wealth, and we believe that a database will not only reduce time, but also get future investors a chance to invest utilizing a wise tool to aid them :).

## Problem Description

* **Problem domain**:
Creating a database with this data would address a problem faced by investors and financial analysts. Companies can have different means of reporting which makes it inefficient and time-consuming to look at. Specifically, finding and retrieving the exact information is a waste of time for investors who want to get their data as soon as possible to make investment decisions, especially with the fast-paced and changing nature of the markets. For example, I had to look for information on multiple website wasting around 3-4 hours of time just searching for the most accurate information in order to make stock pitches for the Student Managed Investment Portfolio (SMIP) which is an investment club at VCU.

* **Need**:
A database is needed to store and organize financial information and is useful for quicker decision-making processes and better management of all the existing data. 

* **Context, scope, and perspective**: 
The database is useful for investors and for those who want to get experience reading financial statements to make investment decisions. It takes a long time to look for accurate information about a company and we thought it would be better to have all that important information in one place for users to access that data. For example, if I wanted to decide whether or not to invest in Nvidia, I would first take a look at financial statements to see the financial health of the company to see how they’re doing and then decide whether or not the stock would be a buy, sell, or hold.

* **User roles and use cases**:
The consumer target is primarily investors in the stock market whether it is a millionaire or a novice who is just getting started. These are the people who will mostly be using our database to fetch financial data for a company they wish to know more about. For example, if an investor wants to get the earningsfor a company like Apple, they can use the database to search the company and find the earnings at a specific point of time. If an investor decides whether or not buying Apple stock would be a good decision, they can use earnings as one of the indicators to make that decision utilizing the database with the data we provide. The database will be use an API that will fetch data from a trusted source to store it in the database. 

* **Security and Privacy**: 
The only security concern that we could think of is whether or not the information from the source we get it from is accurate. Another issue could be that in case there is a data breach and all information is lost, then it will be harder for our customers to gain access to essential information.


## Database Design

* **Company**: represents a business organization and has a unique ID. 
* **Stock**: represents stock information and has a unique stock ticker. 
* **Income_Statement**: represents financial performance and has a unique statement ID.
* **Balance_Sheet**: represents a company's financial position and has a unique statement ID. 
* **Cash_Flow**: represents cash inflows and outflows and has a unique statement ID.
* **Earnings**: represents financial earnings and has a unique earnings ID.
